This file describes how to build, setup, configure and run the performance testing tool.

1. 	Build Apache Ranger using the following command.
	% mvn clean compile package assembly:assembly

	The following artifact will be created under target directory.

	target/ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools.tar.gz

2. 	Copy this artifact to the directory where you want to run the tool.

	% cp target/ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools.tar.gz <perf-tool-run-dir>
	% cd <perf-tool-run-dir>

3.	Unzip the artifact.

	% tar xvfz ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools.tar.gz

	This will create the following directory structure under <perf-tool-run-dir>

	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools
	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools/conf
	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools/dist
	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools/lib
	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools/scripts
	ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools/testdata

4.	% cd ranger-0.5.0-ranger-tools

5.	Configure the policies and requests to use in the test run

	Following sample data files are packaged with the perf-tool:
		service-policies   - testdata/test_servicepolicies_hive.json
		requests           - testdata/test_requests_hive.json
		modules-to-profile - testdata/test_modules.txt

	Please review the contents of these files and modify (or copy/modify) to suite your policy and request needs.

	Update conf/log4j.properties to specify the filename where perf run results will be written to. Property to update is 'ranger.perf.logger'.

6.	Run the tool with the following command

	% ./ranger-perftester.sh -s <service-policies-file>  -r <requests-file> -p <profiled-modules-file> -c <number-of-concurrent-clients> -n <number-of-times-requests-file-to-be-run>

	Example:
	% ./ranger-perftester.sh -s testdata/test_servicepolicies_hive.json  -r testdata/test_requests_hive.json -p testdata/test_modules.txt -c 2 -n 1

7. 	At the end of the run, the performance-statistics are printed on the console and in the log specified file in conf/log4j.properties file.
